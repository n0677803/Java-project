run server
server loops checking for incoming objects

run login
enter login details
push login button
new array of strings created and contains "HndlLog" and username and password

new thread runs to talk to server
login tries to connect to server and send it the array of strings login
server sends that object to handler
handler gets the object with hndllog and user and pass
because of "HndlLog" handler runs the if block for that

handler compares username to every username in the file until it gets a match

handler then compares the password to that usersnames password to see if it gets a match

if it gets both matched it opens the main user screen with the username that is logged in

the main user screen uses the user name and calls the hndlretrieve which uses the username to get all the users data and then populates the main user screen
